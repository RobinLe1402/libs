# RobinLe Libraries
This repository is my main code base I'm constantly working on expanding and improving.


## Directory structure
In this repo, I mainly use the UNIX-style directory structure typical for libraries etc.

Here's a definition of what each directory contains:

| Dir | Contents |
|-----|----------|
| `bin` | *(only locally)* non-library binary files (compiled from `test` and `tools`) |
| `doc` | Misc. non-wiki documentation files |
| `etc` | Misc. non-sourcecode files |
| `include` | `.hpp` and `.h` files for including |
| `lib` | *(only locally)* `.dll` and `.lib` files (compiled from `src`) |
| `res` | Misc. resource files |
| `src` | Library source code |
| `template` | Misc. template files |
| `test` | Source code for test applications (mainly for testing libraries) |
| `tools` | Source code for misc. applications |
| `vs` | Visual Studio-specific files |


## Executable downloads
Since this repository is the home of a multiple of unrelated applications and the GitHub release feed is not too good for this purpose, I outsourced downloads of executables to my own website.

## Documentation
For detailed documentation, visit [this repository's wiki](https://lnk.robinle.de/git/wiki/libs).

Sorry it's currently in a poorly maintained, outdated state. But I'm working on it!
