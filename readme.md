# RobinLe Libraries
In this repository, I'm currently working on sources that are supposed to one day be part of static game engine libraries.

I'm planning to create at least a NES-like game engine and a simple, png-based 2D game engine.

## Executable downloads
Since this repository is the home of a multiple of unrelated applications and the GitHub release feed is not too good for this purpose, I outsourced downloads of executables to my own website.
