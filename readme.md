# RobinLe Libraries
In this repository, I'm currently working on sources that are supposed to one day be part of static game engine libraries.

I'm planning to create at least a NES-like game engine and a simple, png-based 2D game engine.

For detailed documentation, visit [this repository's wiki](../../wiki).
